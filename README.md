# dead-time-logic-of-nuclear-detectors
 For detection systems that record discrete events, such as particle and nuclear detectors, the dead time is the time after each event
 during which the system is not able to record another event. An everyday life example of this is what happens when someone takes
 a photo using a flash, another picture cannot be taken immediately afterward because the flash needs a few seconds to recharge. 
 
 This code is focused on dead time and the subsequent count loss estimation in radiation detection systems. The dead time is
 the minimum amount of time required between two events to permit detection of those events individually by a radiation
 detection system. If events occur during the system dead time, they are lost. Such lost information can be important in
 many applications including high-precision spectroscopy, positron emission tomography (PET), and the scanning of spent
 nuclear fuel.  
 
 Understanding of the behavior of radiation detection systems is important; thus this work included a comprehensive review
 of dead time and pulse pile-up models and methods.
